### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
#### Wins:
- Able to display website element according to styles specified in the project specifications page.
- Got the website to display randomly-selected recipes.

#### Challenges:
- I struggled with adding functionality to a feature that would have allowed for users to make their own custome recipes. Although I made some progress with that goal, it was not as much as I would have expected. This feature has not been implemented into this project.
- I also had trouble with getting some elements of the web application to display correctly. I used results from a web search egine to lead me to retrieve the correct answers.
